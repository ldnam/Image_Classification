# AI Project
Intel Image Classification
Student: Le Dinh Nam
Student ID: V202000210

Overview of the project: I want to build a model that can classify different natural scenes into 6 categories: buildings, streets, glaciers, mountains, forests, sea.

This directory includes:
1. Source code of the project: Intel Image Classification (ipynb file)
2. Report of the project (pdf file)
3. The data sets (seg_pred, seg_train, seg_test)

Libraries used:
1. Torch
2. Torchvision
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

Description:

The project is part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course. This project provides the Intel dataset of images with 6 labels and a test set which will be evaluated after running the resnet50 model. The results are surprising with an accuracy of nearly 93%, higher than most of the models used on the Intel platform at that time.
